I earned my B.Eng. degree from Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics, China, in 2015, and later completed my M.Eng. degree at Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, China, in 2019. Currently, I am actively pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Tianjin University in Tianjin, China, under the guidance of Professor Ou Wu. My research focuses on the exciting fields of data mining and deep learning.
